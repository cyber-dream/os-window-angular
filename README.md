## Roadmap

At the moment, im working on this alone in my free time, using this to build my own portafolio. Also learning in the way how to make, publish and mantain a ***npm*** package.

If i have enough time i will keep this updated periodically. 

If you want to help me, start by reading [Compiling the Library](https://github.com/santinobch/os-window-angular/wiki/Compiling-the-library), and please start an **issue**.

(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

Things i want to implement/fix before 1.0:

- At the moment changing for example the theme of a window at runtime will not work, themes can only be applyed at component initialization.
- Zoom fix (At the moment zooming a maximized window will make some weird behavior)
- Resize Z-Index fix (Resizing a window will not change it's z-index value)
- The Win98 Vaporwave theme needs some love
- Buttons, all of them: Radio, Switches, Checkboxes, etc...
- Text inputs
- Loading bars
- Tool bars
- Tree view

After realease 1.0:

- Add more themes: Win XP, Mac OSX 10.6, Win 3.1, Etc... 
- Eventually some templates (By example a file manager template)
